Course prerequisites
This course requires some familiarity with a few basic operating system concepts like files, directories, and file systems. You'll be using the command line for interacting with Git, so you'll need some familiarity with that as well.

All the examples in this course use Python 3. You'll need a basic grasp of the Python syntax, and the most common data structures and objects. To get the most out of this course, we also strongly recommend that you install software in your machine, or have your system administrator install it. You'll need to install Git to follow our examples, and Python 3 to test out the examples.

We'll use Linux for our examples, but you can follow along with Windows or MacOS computers.
