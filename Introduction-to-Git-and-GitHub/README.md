This is the third course in the program.

Crash Course on Python

Using Python to Interact with the Operating System

Introduction to Git and GitHub (this course)

Troubleshooting and Debugging Techniques

Configuration Management and the Cloud

Automating Real-World Tasks with Python

Course prerequisites
This course requires some familiarity with a few basic operating system concepts like files, directories, and file systems. You'll be using the command line for interacting with Git, so you'll need some familiarity with that as well.

All the examples in this course use Python 3. You'll need a basic grasp of the Python syntax, and the most common data structures and objects. To get the most out of this course, we also strongly recommend that you install software in your machine, or have your system administrator install it. You'll need to install Git to follow our examples, and Python 3 to test out the examples.

We'll use Linux for our examples, but you can follow along with Windows or MacOS computers.

Obtain the Google IT Automation with Python Professional Certificate
To receive your official Google IT Automation with Python Professional Certificate, you must:

Pass all graded assignments in all 6 courses of the certificate program. Each graded assignment is part of a cumulative graded score for the course, and the passing grade for each course is 80%.

AND one of the following:

Pay the
course certificate fee
,

Be approved for
Coursera Financial Aid
, or

Complete the certificate through an educational institution, employer, or agency that's sponsoring your participation.

How deadlines work
When you enroll in the course, the system automatically sets a deadline for when you need to complete each section. Heads up: These deadlines are there to help you organize your time, but you can take the course at your own pace. If you "miss" a deadline, you can just reset it to a new date. There’s no time limit in which you have to finish the course, and you can earn the certificate whenever you finish.

Qwiklabs
For some of our exercises, you'll be using an application called Qwiklabs. Qwiklabs lets you interact with a computer running an operating system that might not be the same one running on your machine. The Qwiklabs scenarios will allow you to solve some real-world problems, putting your knowledge to work through active learning exercises.

Getting and giving help
Here are a few ways you can give and get help:

Connect with other learners: If you have a question, chances are, you’re not alone. You can visit Coursera’s private
Google IT 201 Automation with Python Community
to expand your network, discuss career journeys, and share experiences. You can also check out the
quick start guide.

Study together: It can be hard to find the time to progress through a Google Career Certificate with all life’s distractions.
Register for Study Group
– live study sessions hosted Monday through Thursday that offer you dedicated time and space to focus on your coursework alongside a community of your peers.

Build your Career Identity: Your career identity is the unique value you bring to the workforce.
[Watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xbT4qMrot4)

Finding out more information
Throughout this course, we’ll teach you how to do a range of things with Git and GitHub. While we’ll provide a lot of information through videos and supplemental readings, sometimes you may need to look things up on your own, both now and throughout your career. Things change fast in IT, so it’s critical to do your own research to stay up-to-date on what’s new. We recommend you use your favorite search engine to find more information about the concepts we cover in this course — it’s great practice for the real world!

On top of search results, here are some great Git resources available online:

[Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)
: This book (available online and in print) covers all the fundamentals of how Git works and how to use it. Refer to it if you want to learn more about the subjects that we cover throughout the course.

[Git tutorial](https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial)
: This tutorial includes a very brief reference of all Git commands available. You can use it to quickly review the commands that you need to use.

Note: As you progress this course you may see updated or repeated content due to Google’s regular review of the certificate program to provide the most up-to-date skills and tools in the industry. These changes include the addition of new practice material and supportive content. In addition, Google’s certificate updates sometimes include changes to graded items like quizzes and labs. If you have previously completed a graded item in this course, you may need to take a new assessment to complete this course. We hope the new content will support you on your learning journey!
