Crash Course on Python

Using Python to Interact with the Operating System

Introduction to Git and GitHub (this course)

Troubleshooting and Debugging Techniques

Configuration Management and the Cloud

Automating Real-World Tasks with Python

Course prerequisites
This course requires some familiarity with a few basic operating system concepts like files, directories, and file systems. You'll be using the command line for interacting with Git, so you'll need some familiarity with that as well.

All the examples in this course use Python 3. You'll need a basic grasp of the Python syntax, and the most common data structures and objects. To get the most out of this course, we also strongly recommend that you install software in your machine, or have your system administrator install it. You'll need to install Git to follow our examples, and Python 3 to test out the examples.

We'll use Linux for our examples, but you can follow along with Windows or MacOS computers.

How deadlines work
When you enroll in the course, the system automatically sets a deadline for when you need to complete each section. Heads up: These deadlines are there to help you organize your time, but you can take the course at your own pace. If you "miss" a deadline, you can just reset it to a new date. There’s no time limit in which you have to finish the course, and you can earn the certificate whenever you finish.

Qwiklabs
For some of our exercises, you'll be using an application called Qwiklabs. Qwiklabs lets you interact with a computer running an operating system that might not be the same one running on your machine. The Qwiklabs scenarios will allow you to solve some real-world problems, putting your knowledge to work through active learning exercises.
