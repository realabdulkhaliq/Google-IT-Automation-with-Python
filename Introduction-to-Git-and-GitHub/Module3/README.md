# Introduction to GitHub

In this module, you’ll be introduced to GitHub and learn how it works with Git. You’ll create new repositories and clone those repositories onto your computer. Next, we’ll explain what a remote repository is, how we can work with them, and how we can host them. You’ll get familiar with commands like modify, stage, and commit, which will be used for local changes, as well as the fetch command, which can pull any changes from remote repositories. We'll cover secure shell protocol and when to use API keys. Our final lesson will focus on learning about conflicts. This will allow you to explore the concepts of pull-merge-push workflows, pushing remote branches and rebasing your changes.
