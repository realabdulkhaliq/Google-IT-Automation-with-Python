# Tailor your resume

As you prepare for your job search, you will need to create or update your resume to reflect your experience in order to apply for roles like:

Automation Engineer

Entry-level Python Developer

IT Support Specialist II

Entry-level Software Engineer

Network Engineer

## Tailor the content

Identify what is important to the potential employer. What does the employer want to know about you? Make sure that you carefully read the job description and notice which skills are mentioned. You can also read several job descriptions for the same type of role to identify which skills and requirements show up frequently. For instance, although specifics will vary by role and employer, many Python automation-related roles require the ability to effectively organize and coordinate across teams and projects, manage multiple tasks simultaneously, and communicate effectively. You should take note of these skills and be sure to highlight them using similar terms on your resume.
