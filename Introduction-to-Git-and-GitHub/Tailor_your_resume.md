# Tailor your resume

Automation Engineer

Entry-level Python Developer

IT Support Specialist II

Entry-level Software Engineer

Network Engineer

## Tailor the content

Identify what is important to the potential employer. What does the employer want to know about you? Make sure that you carefully read the job description and notice which skills are mentioned. You can also read several job descriptions for the same type of role to identify which skills and requirements show up frequently. For instance, although specifics will vary by role and employer, many Python automation-related roles require the ability to effectively organize and coordinate across teams and projects, manage multiple tasks simultaneously, and communicate effectively. You should take note of these skills and be sure to highlight them using similar terms on your resume.

Create one primary resume to edit and tailor to each job application. You should make sure that the order of your skills and qualifications matches the job description. In doing this, you are making sure that the things that are most important to the employer are at the top.

Match the language used in the job description. Some employers use automation software to filter resumes. If the job description uses keywords like cloud services and risk management, make sure your resume uses those keywords, too.

Use Python automation terminology. This will help the hiring manager reading your resume understand how your past experience is relevant to the role for which you are applying.
