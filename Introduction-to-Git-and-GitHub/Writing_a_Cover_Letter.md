# Writing a Cover Letter

A cover letter is a personal introduction to promote yourself. It serves as a companion document to a resume. Its main purpose is to elaborate on your professional skills, motivations, and why you should be viewed as the best candidate for a job.

There are three types of cover letters:

Networking—Addressed to individuals to ask for their help in finding a job at their company

Prospecting—Addressed to companies to explore all open job opportunities

Application—Addressed to hiring managers to emphasize your fit for a specific job
