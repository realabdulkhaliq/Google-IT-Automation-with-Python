# Writing a Cover Letter

A cover letter is a personal introduction to promote yourself. It serves as a companion document to a resume. Its main purpose is to elaborate on your professional skills, motivations, and why you should be viewed as the best candidate for a job.

There are three types of cover letters:

Networking—Addressed to individuals to ask for their help in finding a job at their company

Prospecting—Addressed to companies to explore all open job opportunities

Application—Addressed to hiring managers to emphasize your fit for a specific job

This reading focuses on helping you write application cover letters. Employers have “who, what, where, when, why, and how” types of questions when they gather information about job applicants.

Your resume answers:

what you have done

where you worked

when you were employed.

Your application cover letter describes in more detail:

who you are

why you want the job

how you will be successful in the role

Preparing to write a cover letter
Pro tip: Not all job applications require a cover letter. When a cover letter is stated as being optional, it’s best to consider how much a cover letter might improve your standing.

The following are common situations when people prefer to include a cover letter:

When starting out in a career (early career applicant)

When making a career transition

When experience, education, or training isn’t an exact match with the listed requirements

When entering a crowded field of applicants

Many people agree that no cover letter is better than a poorly written one! Even if a cover letter has no obvious errors, submitting a few paragraphs with very general statements isn’t going to help you that much. Before you write a cover letter, follow these steps to ensure you create a meaningful one.
