# The code you provided is an if statement. An if statement is a conditional statement
 that executes a block of code if a certain condition is met. In this case, 
 the condition is whether the is_virtual fact is set to true. The is_virtual fact 
 is a built-in fact that Puppet uses to determine if the node is a virtual machine.

If the is_virtual fact is set to true, then the code in the if statement block will 
be executed. This code will purge the smartmontools package. 
The smartmontools package is a software package that provides tools for 
monitoring and managing hard drives. Purging the smartmontools package on a 
virtual machine is typically done to improve performance.

If the is_virtual fact is set to false, then the code in the else statement 
block will be executed. This code will install the smartmontools package.

In this code block, the value of the is_virtual fact is true, 
so the code in the if statement block will be executed. 
This means that the smartmontools package will be purged.
