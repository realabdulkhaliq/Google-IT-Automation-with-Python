# The code you provided is an if statement. An if statement is a conditional statement
 that executes a block of code if a certain condition is met. In this case, 
 the condition is whether the is_virtual fact is set to true. The is_virtual fact 
 is a built-in fact that Puppet uses to determine if the node is a virtual machine.
