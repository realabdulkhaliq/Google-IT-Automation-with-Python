# Developing an Elevator Pitch

An elevator pitch is a short, memorable description that explains an idea, business, or service in an easy-to-understand way, typically in 60 seconds or less (the average amount of time of an elevator ride).

## Elevator Pitch Examples

To bring the structure of an elevator pitch to life, check out three examples of elevator pitches. The first is by Dan, a Software Developer. The second is Sean, a Marketing Manager on the Google Ads team. The third is by Joi, an Associate Product Marketing Manager.

Dan
Software Developer

I'm Dan, a software developer with 8 years experience developing solutions for logistics. The most recent solution I developed is a database system that prevents large product shipments from being misdirected to the wrong destinations. Outside of my work with logistics, I develop AI software for websites and create websites for clients using that technology. My passion for software development and problem solving is what led me to some of the top logistics organizations. I love solving problems and helping my clients save time and money.

Google is always innovating, which means when you work in this field you never stop learning. My first company actually ran a blog all about the latest changes to Google Ads (then called AdWords), and because of my English degree, I took a keen interest in the blog. In a few months, I was managing the blog, and it was through my posts on that site that Google found me.

It’s been wonderful to be on the team that announces the latest changes and updates to Google Ads. Because of my hands-on experience buying ads myself, I can immediately see how somebody’s workflow will change after an announcement. I love being able to tell Google’s story to our advertisers so that companies of all sizes can continue to find success and grow their businesses.

Joi
Associate Product Marketing Manager

I’m Joi, an Associate Product Marketing Manager at Google with 10 years experience as a content creator for YouTube and organic social channels.

Outside of work, I run my own beauty e-commerce business, an experience that has helped me develop a plethora of skills around digital marketing and paid advertising, project management and operations.

My entrepreneurial mindset paired with my love for creativity is what led me to a company like Google. I thrive in ambiguity and love strategizing and solving problems from the ground up.
