# Monitoring tools

## Windows processes

Windows Process Monitor, also known as Sysinternals, is a powerful monitoring tool that serves as an advanced task manager. It provides real-time insight into various aspects of the system, including file system operations, registry changes, processes, and threads. The tool excels at diagnosing file access issues, analyzing system configurations, and understanding processes.

## Linux performance

To enhance your Linux system's performance, you can use specialized tools that offer real-time insights into CPU, memory, disk I/O, and network activity for quick performance bottleneck detection. Some of these tools include Perf-tools, bcc/BPF, and bpftrace.

### The USE method

The USE Method is essential for optimizing system performance and troubleshooting servers. It helps identify resource bottlenecks and performance issues by analyzing Utilization, Saturation, and Errors. Resources like CPUs, memory, storage, and network interfaces can be measured for busy time, additional workload capacity, and errors.
