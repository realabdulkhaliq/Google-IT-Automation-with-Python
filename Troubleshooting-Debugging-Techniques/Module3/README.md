## Blue screen of death (BSoD)

A common disruption in computing systems is the kernel panic in Mac OS, also known as the notorious "Blue Screen of Death" (BSoD) in Windows, both of which require restarting the computer. Although rare, analyzing these occurrences is essential for uncovering OS issues. BSoDs are usually caused by hardware glitches, problematic drivers, or abrupt process terminations. These failure screens display error codes, memory locations, and technical insights related to the crash.

## Reading system logs

System logs are crucial for understanding and resolving issues across multiple operating systems. Whether you're using a Mac, Linux, or another system, delving into these logs can yield valuable insights. Analyzing logs is critical for identifying system errors and crashes on Windows computers. The Windows logs such as System and Application carefully record data retrieval events, providing insight into software, hardware, and user interaction.

### Mac System Logs

Mac system logs provide insights into system operations. By using the Console app, you can capture error messages, warnings, and interactions between hardware and software. These logs are especially useful when investigating system behavior.

### Linux System Logs

Linux system logs offer insights into troubleshooting. They give detailed information about the Linux environment, such as errors and hardware-software interactions. Using command-line utilities, you can access these logs to identify unusual behavior patterns. These logs provide a holistic overview of system performance.

## Process Monitor

Monitoring tools like Process Monitor in Windows provide real-time visibility into file system actions, registry changes, and process behavior. With features from legacy tools such as Regmon and Filemon, Process Monitor captures input/output parameters, uses non-destructive filtering, identifies root causes, and compiles comprehensive process data. This includes details such as image paths, commands, user information, and session IDs. The tool offers customizable columns, flexible filters, and scalable logging to enhance event management. Tooltips provide quick access to log files and reveal process relationships. It also records boot-time operations for comprehensive tracking, troubleshooting, malware detection, and system activity analysis.
