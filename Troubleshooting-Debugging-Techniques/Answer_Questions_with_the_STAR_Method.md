# Answer Questions with the STAR Method

The STAR method is a technique for answering interview questions. Responses are structured to describe:

Situation: Give a brief description of a situation in which you excelled.

Task: Explain the goal of the situation.

Action: Describe the specific action(s) you took in the situation.

Result: Tell about the positive results of your actions.

Your STAR responses should focus on your involvement in the situation. Avoid describing the actions and results achieved by someone else.

As you’ve learned, STAR stands for “situation,” “task,” “action,” and “result.”
