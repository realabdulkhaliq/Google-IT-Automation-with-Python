# Answer Questions with the STAR Method

The STAR method is a technique for answering interview questions. Responses are structured to describe:

Situation: Give a brief description of a situation in which you excelled.

Task: Explain the goal of the situation.

Action: Describe the specific action(s) you took in the situation.

Result: Tell about the positive results of your actions.

Your STAR responses should focus on your involvement in the situation. Avoid describing the actions and results achieved by someone else.
