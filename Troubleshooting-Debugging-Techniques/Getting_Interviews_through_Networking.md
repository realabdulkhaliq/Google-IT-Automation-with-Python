# Getting Interviews through Networking

## The Importance of Networking

Learning how to network effectively is a really valuable skill with a wide range of benefits. It’s something you’ll want to continue to focus on, and the connections you make and maintain through strategic networking can have long-lasting positive effects on your career advancement.

Strategic networking can help you overcome some of the challenges associated with online job applications. Some of the benefits of networking include:

Getting accurate information about job availability. The fact that a role is posted online doesn’t mean that the hiring team is actively reviewing applications. There is often a delay between the time a role is open and the time it’s posted online, as well as the time it is filled and taken down from online job boards. At the same time, there are often open positions that are not (yet) posted online for a variety of reasons. Networking can help you ensure you’ve got up-to-date information.

Learning more details about the role. Job descriptions are not always precise. As a result, you might end up applying for roles that you think are a good fit but are, in fact, not. Or, you might fail to properly tailor your application to meet the needs of the hiring team. Insider information via networking can help you understand what the team is really looking for.

Standing out amid the competition. Once a job is posted to a job board, there are often tens or even hundreds of people applying to it. It can be difficult to stand out. Networking can help you get an early jump on a new opportunity before it’s posted.

The networking process described in this guide can help you address all these challenges.

Through a short and focused conversation with someone at your target company, who has insider knowledge of relevant opportunities, you will be able to:

Understand the requirements for your target role at that specific company. Jobs with the same title can vary greatly from company to company, and the actual requirements are not always obvious from job descriptions.

Gain insight into the company’s organizational structure and team culture to learn what’s required for success, and understand how best to position yourself in your application materials and interviews.

Learn about ways to monitor and apply for opportunities at that specific company, so you can know exactly what’s available and how to float your application to the top of the pile. You might even be able to get a referral.

Establish a relationship with a professional who might be able to help you in your current job search and be a part of your professional network moving forward.

## Networking for Your Job Search: The Process

How to connect with the right people

The process of networking for your job search begins with identifying the right people to network with. You are looking for insider information on the role and its application process, as well as other relevant opportunities.

People you select to network with should work in, or close to, your target role at a company you are interested in working for. These people will have the information you need, beyond what’s publicly posted online. They will likely understand the exact skills and qualities the hiring team is looking for. They may know the status of currently open roles and upcoming openings, and they might even be able to connect you directly to the hiring team.

If you are already connected to the right people, you can jump straight to Step 2 below. If you don’t currently know such people, begin with finding and connecting with them as described in Step 1.

### Step 1: Finding the right people

To begin, put together a list of the companies you’re interested in. The more companies you have on your list, the more people you will be able to reach out to, and the more opportunities that will be available to you. Don’t be surprised if your company list grows to 50 or more companies. It might sound like a lot, but remember that not every company will have the right role available when you need it.
