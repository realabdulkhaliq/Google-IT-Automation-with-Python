# Consider the following scenario about using Python lists: 
# A professor gave his two assistants, Aniyah and Imani, the task of keeping an attendance 
# list of students in the order they arrived in the classroom. Aniyah was the first 
# one to note which students arrived, and then Imani took over. 
# After class, they each entered their lists into the computer and emailed them to the professor. 
# The professor wants to combine the two lists into one and sort it in alphabetical order. 

# Complete the code by combining the two lists into one and then sorting the new list. 
# This function should:

# accept two lists through the functionâ€™s parameters;,
# combine the two lists;
# sort the combined list in alphabetical order;
# return the new list. 

def alphabetize_lists(list1, list2):


  new_list = [] # Initialize a new list.
  combined_list = list1 + list2 # Combine the lists.
  print(combined_list)
  combined_list.sort() # Sort the combined lists.
  new_list = combined_list # Assign the combined lists to the "new_list".
  return new_list 


Aniyahs_list = ["Jacomo", "Emma", "Uli", "Nia", "Imani"]
Imanis_list = ["Loik", "Gabriel", "Ahmed", "Soraya"]


print(alphabetize_lists(Aniyahs_list, Imanis_list))
# Should print: ['Ahmed', 'Emma', 'Gabriel', 'Imani', 'Jacomo', 'Loik', 'Nia', 'Soraya', 'Uli']
