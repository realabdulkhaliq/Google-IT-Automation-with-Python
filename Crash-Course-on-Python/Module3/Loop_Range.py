# This loop iterates on the value of the "number" variable in a range
# of 2 to 7+1 (the value of the end-of-range index 7 is excluded, so 
# +1 has been added to the parameter to include the numeric value 7 in 
# the range). The incremental value for the loop is the default of +1.
# The print() function will output the resulting value of "number" 
# multiplied by 3.


for number in range(2,7+1):
    print(number*3)


# The loop should print 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21
