# Range Key takeaways

The roles of the range(start, stop, step) function parameters are:

- Start - Beginning of range

  - value included in range

  - default = 0

- Stop - End of range

  - value excluded from range (to include, use stop+1)

  - no default

  - must provide the ending index number

- Step - Incremental value

  - default = 1

## Additional advanced string loop techniques

There are additional ways to loop over a string in Python that you should learn, practice, and master. These additional looping techniques include the generator functions, `map()`, and `zip()`. The `map()` and `zip()` functions are extremely powerful string manipulation tools that demonstrate functional programming concepts. To learn more about these advanced techniques, see these resources:

- [Python - map() function](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/python/python-map-function)

- [Python zip() method](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/python/zip-method)

Pro Tip: Looping over multiple strings at once can push the limits of for loops. Because of this, itâ€™s important to be aware of other alternatives to simplify a for or while loop.
