# Range Key takeaways

The roles of the range(start, stop, step) function parameters are:

- Start - Beginning of range

  - value included in range

  - default = 0

- Stop - End of range

  - value excluded from range (to include, use stop+1)

  - no default

  - must provide the ending index number

- Step - Incremental value

  - default = 1
