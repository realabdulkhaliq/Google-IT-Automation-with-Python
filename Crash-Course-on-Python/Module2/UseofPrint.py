# The following 5 lines assign strings to a list of variables.
salutation = "Dr."
first_name = "Prisha"
middle_name = "Jai"
last_name = "Agarwal"
suffix = "Ph.D."
 
print(salutation + " " + first_name + " " + middle_name + " " + last_name + ", " + suffix) 
# The comma as a string ", " adds the conventional use of a comma plus a 
# space to separate the last name from the suffix.
 
# Alternatively, you could use commas in place of the + connector:
print(salutation, first_name, middle_name, last_name,",", suffix)
# However, you will find that this produces a space before a comma within a string.
