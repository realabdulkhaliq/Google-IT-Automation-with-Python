# Bash Scripting

In this module, you’ll be exposed to what the Linux OS has to offer and you'll learn about Bash scripting. We’ll go over basic Linux commands and explore the many processes Linux has to offer, including a key concept called redirection. We’ll then deep dive into creating Bash scripts using variables and globs. Finally, we’ll learn about advanced Bash concepts and develop an understanding of when to use Bash versus Python.
