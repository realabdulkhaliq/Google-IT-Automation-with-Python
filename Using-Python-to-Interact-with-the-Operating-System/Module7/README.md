# Final Project

In this module, you’ll put everything you’ve learned so far into action! You’ll apply your scripting knowledge to tackle a challenging final project: writing a script that scans for a specific error in the log files. You'll create a problem statement to understand the challenge, conduct some research to see what options are available, then begin planning how you intend to solve the problem. Lastly, you'll write the code to implement your solution!
**Learning Objectives**
Approach a problem using frameworks and best practices
Formulate a problem statement to understand the inputs and outputs of a script
Create a planned approach to solve the problem
Write a complex script to solve a problem
